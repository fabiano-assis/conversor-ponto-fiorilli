Fiorilli point file to layout converter (with graphical interface)
During the Human Resources department routine, we faced an issue where files generated by new time clock devices were not being imported into the time and attendance system.

To address this problem, I developed a program that converts AFD files into the layout required by the system, successfully restoring compatibility and ensuring the correct import of time records.
